> **<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *Semantic image segmentation, the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a particular class, plays an important role in many visual understanding systems. In the context of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms, the choice of an appropriate loss function is crucial for training the model effectively.
It quantifies the difference between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth, providing a measure of how well the model is performing. To aid researchers in identifying the optimal loss function for their particular application, this survey provides a comprehensive and unified review of $25$ loss functions utilized in image segmentation. We provide a novel taxonomy and thorough review of how these loss functions are customized and leveraged in image segmentation, with a systematic categorization emphasizing their significant features and applications. Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of these methods in real-world scenarios, we propose unbiased evaluations of renowned loss functions on established medical and natural image datasets. We conclude this review by identifying current challenges and unveiling future research opportunities.* </p>
